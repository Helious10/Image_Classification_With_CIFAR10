-----------
CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project with Pipelines and Parameter Tuning

**Objective: Developed and deployed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 10 categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implemented data processing pipelines and parameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Tools & Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: PyTorch, torchvision, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, scikit-learn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (for cloud-based execution)
Key Contributions:

Data Processing Pipelines:

Applied data augmentations to improve model generalization using torchvision transforms.
Implemented normalization to standardize input data.
Model Development:

Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.
Implemented fully connected layers for classification.

**Training and Optimization:

Utilized CrossEntropyLoss as the loss function and Adam optimizer for efficient training.
Conducted parameter tuning to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
Evaluation:

Achieved an overall test accuracy of 75% after parameter tuning.
Performed class-wise accuracy analysis to identify and address model weaknesses.
Visualization:

Visualized training images and their corresponding labels to verify data integrity.
Displayed sample predictions alongside ground truth labels for qualitative assessment.
Deployment:

Ensured reproducibility by setting random seeds and documenting the process.
Prepared a detailed report and Jupyter Notebook with code, results, and visualizations.
